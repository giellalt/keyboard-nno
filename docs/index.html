    <p>Why a nynorsk keyboard? «There is already Norwegian keyboards everywhere»
    you may point out. That is of course absolutely true, and for desktop
    systems there is no need for a nynorsk Norwegian keyboard. For mobile
    systems, though, the situation is different. There are Norwegian keyboards,
    but they are always <strong>bokmål</strong> keyboards, and spell checking
    and word completion works really bad. That is, reason number one is to be
    able to provide a better writing experience for nynorsk writers on mobile
    systems when we have support for spellers, word completion etc. Not there
    yet, but we are working on it.

    <p>The second reason, and the main reason for building the Runic variant
    (besides the fun of it), is to test our keyboard infrastructure, and make
    sure it works properly for alternative writing systems. I.e. this is done to
    test both our code and infra, and how well the host operating systems and
    applications are playing along when presented with things a bit outside the
    standard. Most of our languages are a bit outside the standard majority
    languages.
