# Documentation for the Norwegian Nynorsk keyboards
Why a nynorsk keyboard? «There is already Norwegian keyboards
everywhere» you may point out. That is of course absolutely true, and
for desktop systems there is no need for a nynorsk Norwegian keyboard.
For mobile systems, though, the situation is different. There are
Norwegian keyboards, but they are always **bokmål** keyboards, and spell
checking and word completion works really bad. That is, reason number
one is to be able to provide a better writing experience for nynorsk
writers on mobile systems when we have support for spellers, word
completion etc. Not there yet, but we are working on it.

The second reason, and the main reason for building the Runic variant
(besides the fun of it), is to test our keyboard infrastructure, and
make sure it works properly for alternative writing systems. I.e. this
is done to test both our code and infra, and how well the host operating
systems and applications are playing along when presented with things a
bit outside the standard. Most of our languages are a bit outside the
standard majority languages.
